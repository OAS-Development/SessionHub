// SESSION 6: Cloudinary File Storage Integration
// Time: 75 minutes | Goal: Complete file upload system with optimization

/* SESSION 6 OVERVIEW:
Build comprehensive file storage system using Cloudinary for image optimization,
file management, and seamless integration with SessionHub learning system.
Leverage Session 5's Redis caching for CDN optimization.

CURRENT STATUS:
âœ… Redis Caching: 70% performance improvement, 65-80% hit rates
âœ… Learning System: Capturing all interaction and performance patterns
âœ… Database: Supabase PostgreSQL fully operational
âœ… Authentication: Clerk working perfectly
ðŸŽ¯ NOW: Add file storage with cache-optimized delivery!

SESSION 6 DELIVERABLES:
1. âœ… Cloudinary client with upload/optimization configuration
2. âœ… File upload API with validation, processing, and cache integration
3. âœ… Image optimization pipeline with automatic transformations
4. âœ… File management dashboard with upload/delete/organize capabilities
5. âœ… Learning system tracking of file operation effectiveness patterns

FILE STORAGE STRATEGY:
- Images: Auto-optimization (WebP/AVIF), quality selection, lazy loading
- Documents: Type validation, secure storage, organized by project
- User Assets: Avatar handling, profile images, session screenshots
- Cache Integration: CDN optimization with Redis metadata caching

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- Upload success rate >95%
- Image optimization automatic (multiple formats)
- File operations cached for 1 hour (static assets)
- Upload progress indicators with real-time feedback
- Learning system captures file interaction patterns

FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY:
- lib/cloudinary.ts - Cloudinary client and optimization utilities
- lib/file-upload.ts - Upload validation, processing, and cache integration
- app/api/upload/route.ts - Multi-part file upload endpoint
- app/api/files/route.ts - File management operations (CRUD)
- components/FileUpload.tsx - Drag-drop upload interface
- components/FileManager.tsx - File browser and management
- lib/hooks/useFileUpload.ts - Upload progress and state management
- app/dashboard/files/page.tsx - Complete file management interface

REDIS CACHE INTEGRATION:
- File metadata cached for quick listing (1 hour TTL)
- Upload progress cached for real-time updates
- Image optimization settings cached per user
- File operation patterns tracked in learning system

CURSOR AI TASKS:
Implement complete file storage system with Cloudinary optimization and Redis caching integration.
