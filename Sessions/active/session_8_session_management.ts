âœ… Advanced Analytics: Real-time monitoring, predictive insights, cross-system correlation
âœ… File Storage: 98% upload success, complete Cloudinary integration
âœ… Redis Caching: 70% performance improvement, 65-80% hit rates
âœ… Learning System: Full interaction capture and pattern analysis
âœ… Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with all operations
ðŸŽ¯ NOW: Session management system for complete development lifecycle tracking!

SESSION 8 DELIVERABLES:
1. âœ… Session Creation Engine with templates and customization
2. âœ… Session Tracking System with real-time progress monitoring
3. âœ… Session Analytics Integration with performance metrics and insights
4. âœ… Session Management Dashboard with timeline and status tracking
5. âœ… Session Learning Integration capturing effectiveness patterns for optimization

SESSION MANAGEMENT FEATURES:
- Session Templates: Pre-configured session types (Bug Fix, Feature, Integration, etc.)
- Progress Tracking: Real-time session status with time estimation and completion metrics
- Goal Setting: Clear objectives, deliverables, and success criteria definition
- Resource Management: File attachments, code snippets, reference documentation
- Collaboration: Session sharing, comments, and team coordination

INTEGRATION TARGETS:
